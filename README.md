# TRINH (JASMINE) TRAN - Business Data Analyst Portfolio
## About

Hello everyone, welcome to my portfolio! 

This is Trinh (Jasmine) and I'm a recent graduate from St. Olaf College with a BA degree in Quantitative Economics and concentrations in Data Science and Management Studies. I'm a strategic and data-driven business data analyst who loves to use data to generate key insights that drive growth and customer engagement. 

During my undergraduate time, I have developed a strong analytical and technical background in business management, marketing, and data science. I have expertise in R, SQL, Excel, Tableau, and other creative tools such as Canva and Adobe. I had opportunities to deal with large datasets, do data wrangling and transformation, and statistical modelling analysis to identify underlying patterns and trends. Also, I gained decent experience in creating insightful visualizations and preparing reports to communicate my work with various stakeholders. I strongly believe that my undergraduate experience builds a good foundation for me to further improve myself as a business data analyst.

This is a repository where I showcase my skills, projects, and keep track of my learning progress in learning Business Analysis. I'm always open to new opportunities and feedback/discussion so please feel free to reach me at tranlequetrinh2724@gmail.com.

### Coffee Quality Prediction

**Code:** [HTML RPubs](http://rpubs.com/trinhjasminetran27/1223031)

**Data Source:** [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2020/2020-07-07)

**Description:** The project aims to predict which characteristics determine the quality of coffee beans based on 4 machine learning models built on a public dataset of 1339 beans from the Coffee Quality Institute's review in January 2018. Some characteristics are aroma, acidity, aftertaste, continent of origin, species, uniformity. Comparison between models was made to identify similarities and differences of each, then uncover the most important indicators of coffee quality.

**Skills:** data cleaning, EDA, data visualization, machine learning modelling (K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, Ridge Regression, LASSO Regression), model interpretation

**Technology:** R (tidyverse, ggplot2, tidymodels, dplyr)

**Results:**
