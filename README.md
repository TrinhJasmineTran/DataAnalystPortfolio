# TRINH (JASMINE) TRAN - Business Data Analyst Portfolio
## About

Hello everyone, welcome to my portfolio! 

This is Trinh (Jasmine) and I'm a recent graduate from St. Olaf College with a BA degree in Quantitative Economics and concentrations in Data Science and Management Studies. I'm a strategic and data-driven business data analyst who loves to use data to generate key insights that drive growth and customer engagement. 

During my undergraduate time, I have developed a strong analytical and technical background in business management, marketing, and data science. I have expertise in R, SQL, Excel, Tableau, and other creative tools such as Canva and Adobe. I had opportunities to deal with large datasets, do data wrangling and transformation, and statistical modelling analysis to identify underlying patterns and trends. Also, I gained decent experience in creating insightful visualizations and preparing reports to communicate my work with various stakeholders. I strongly believe that my undergraduate experience builds a good foundation for me to further improve myself as a business data analyst.

This is a repository where I showcase my skills, projects, and keep track of my learning progress in learning Business Analysis. I'm always open to new opportunities and feedback/discussion so please feel free to reach me at tranlequetrinh2724@gmail.com.

For more information, please check out my CV here.

### Coffee Quality Prediction

**Code:** [HTML RPubs](http://rpubs.com/trinhjasminetran27/1223031)

**Data Source:** [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2020/2020-07-07)

**Description and Overview:** The project aims to predict which characteristics determine the quality of coffee beans based on 4 machine learning models built on a public dataset of 1339 beans from the Coffee Quality Institute's review in January 2018. Some characteristics are aroma, acidity, aftertaste, continent of origin, species, uniformity. Comparison between models was made to identify similarities and differences of each, then uncover the most important indicators of coffee quality.

***Data Manipulation:*** I tidied, summarized, and modified raw data to eliminate irrelevant variables, null values, and multicollinearity. Then, divided the data into training (70%) and testing (30%) datasets.
***Explanatory Data Analysis:*** I created histograms and scatterplot to discover the distribution of coffee grade and the correlation between numeric variables.
***K-Nearest Neighbors Regression:*** using the optimal number of neighbors (17) to predict the grade of a particular bean in the data, 87% of the variability of bean quality is explained by this model.
***Random Forest:*** 93% of the variability of bean quality is explained by this model with 100 trees and 7 important variables.
***Ridge Regression:*** with the optimal penalty of only 0.001, this model explains 95.4% of the variability of coffee quality.
***LASSO Regression:*** this model explains the coffee grade even better, at 95.6% with 0.0183 optimal penalty.

**Skills:** data cleaning, EDA, data visualization, machine learning modelling (K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, Ridge Regression, LASSO Regression), model interpretation

**Technology:** R (tidyverse, ggplot2, tidymodels, dplyr)

**Results:**

### Handwritten Digit Recognition Using Machine Learning Algorithms

**Code:** [Report in PDF](https://github.com/TrinhJasmineTran/DataAnalystPortfolio/blob/da1d5bb25f32eceeef94f8379381413821bcbe27/Challenge_1_Official_341.pdf)

**Description:** The project focuses on creating an end-to-end classifier of handwritten 7s and 3s by constructing two potential features and tested them on the digits of the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) database. 

- ***Left Center Border:*** go through columns 14, 15, and 16 of the corresponding matrix, store the ROW number of the first non-zero cell in each column, then take the average of the three row numbers. Note that the matrix must be rotated 90 degree counterclockwise to have the corresponding image.

- ***Total Lower Right Quadrant Darkness:*** go through each row and column of this quadrant and sum the pixel value for each cell. Note the the matrix must be rotated 90 degree counterclockwise to have the corresponding image.
