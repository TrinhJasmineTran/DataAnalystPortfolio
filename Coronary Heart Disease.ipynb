CHD is a complex disease that is influenced by several risk factors, including age, gender, family history, smoking, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and obesity. These risk factors can interact with each other to increase the risk of developing CHD. The body's cholesterol level, smoking behavior, obesity, family history of illnesses, blood pressure, and work environment are all factors that affect heart disease. According to the literature review named \"Cholesterol, coronary heart disease, and stroke in the Asia Pacific region\", in both Asian and non-Asian populations in the Asia-Pacific region, total cholesterol is strongly associated with the risk of CHD and ischemic, but not hemorrhagic, stroke[^2].\n",

In addition, hypertension poses a significant risk for CHD due to the additional strain it exerts on the heart and blood vessels, which over time causes damage and dysfunction.Blood pressure medication can aid in managing hypertension, but they also involve a risk of CHD-related side effects. Elevated blood glucose levels, a symptom of diabetes, are also associated with an increased risk of CHD.

Additional characteristics including total cholesterol level, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), heart rate, and blood glucose level were taken into account when determining patient's present medical status. Height and weight were measured, and body mass index (kg/m\\^2) was calculated. Two blood pressure determinations were made after the participant had been sitting for at least 5 minutes, and the average was used for analyses. Hypertension was categorized according to blood pressure readings. Diabetes was considered present if the participant was under treatment with insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents if casual blood glucose determinations exceeded 150 mg/dL.

The same pattern applies to those who previously had a stroke. 38.1% of patients with the history of stroke are likely to develop CHD compared to 15.1% of individuals without previous stroke occurrence. The proportion of smokers and non-smokers is approximately the same in both ten year CHD risk and no risk group. The number of cigarettes smoked per day have a slight linear trend according to the conditional density plot. The box plots and summary statistics were used to compare quantitative variables those with and without ten year CHD risk. The patient group with heart disease risk had a higher mean age than those without it, and conditional density plot shows stronger relationship between age and ten year CHD risk. There are many observations in the data set whose cholesterol levels are extremely high. On the interval from 100 to 400 mg/dL, the total level of cholesterol is normally distributed while on the wider internal of (100,600), the distribution is highly right-skewed. Age also highly correlates with the chance of developing coronary heart disease. As age increases, the chance increases, with a relatively positive linear relationship. Additionally, the linearity conditions were checked using conditional density plot and holds true for all our models.\n",

The BMI (0.331) and age (0.389) seem to have moderate positive correlation with systolic blood pressure.

A drop in deviance test provides statistically significant evidence with G value of 16.97 and p value 3.70e-05 that adding the interaction between BMI and systolic BP improves our ability to explain variability in patients' probability of being diagnosed for ten-year CHD risk.

Males have a larger risk of developing heart disease than females do, and coronary heart disease is more common in men. Current literature suggests that this is because men have worse coping mechanisms (physiologically, behaviorally, emotionally) that lead to reduced adaptability to stressful situations as compared to females, increasing their risk for CHD[^4]. It's interesting to note how the LASSO model does not include some of the factors that we believe to be important predictors, such as BMI and BPMeds. It is likely that additional variables in the model are accounting for the effect of these removed variables on the result. For instance, there is frequently a strong correlation between BMI and other indicators including age, gender, and cholesterol levels. The effect of BMI can be redundant and so removed by the LASSO because the other variables are already present in the model and are highly predictive of the risk of ten year CHD.\n",

                "Despite the fact that our study has several advantages, such as a large number of samples and extensive statistical analysis, there are some drawbacks to take into account. First off, the demographics in this study's data were not diverse in terms of ethnic and racial groups because they came from a specific region This limits our ability to generalize the data from the Massachusetts town of Framingham to a larger population. Furthermore, as this study is an observational one, we are unable to draw any conclusions about causality from it. Furthermore, other potential confounding variables including family history, physical activity, and diet that may affect the risk of heart disease were not taken into account in our study. The ongoing study of Framingham town now started considering these factors and have larger diverse population which potentially will increase the credibility of the study.The ongoing study of Framingham Town has now begun to take these issues into account and has a larger, more diversified population, which may enhance the study's credibility. \\newpage\n",
